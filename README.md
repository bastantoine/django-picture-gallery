# Picture gallery
A small picture gallery built with Django

## How to deploy?

Deployement is made relatively easy in this project with the help of Docker containers.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (obviously...)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) as well
- A working web server, such as Apache or Nginx. You don't need anything in particular, or anything that can handle WSGI request, it will only act as a reverse proxy to route the incoming request to the Nginx container.

### 1. Get the code

`git clone https://github.com/bastantoine/django-picture-gallery.git`

### 2. Configure the `.env` files

Inside `docker/prod/env` you will find 3 files `db.prod.env.sample`, `django.prod.env.sample` and `gunicorn.prod.env.sample`.

First copy them and remove the `.sample`.
Then update the values if needed:
- `db.prod.env`:
  - `POSTGRES_USER`: the username to use in the Postgres DB
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password to use in the Postgres DB
  - `POSTGRES_DB`: the database to use in Postgres
  - Note: there are others environment variables you can set there, check out the [PG Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) for more info
- `django.prod.env`:
  - `SQL_ENGINE`: Leave it to `django.db.backends.postgresql` if you are using the Postgres container
  - `SQL_DATABASE`: Same value as `POSTGRES_DB`
  - `SQL_USER`: Same value as `POSTGRES_USER`
  - `SQL_PASSWORD`: Same value as `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
  - `SQL_HOST`: Leave it to `db` if you are using the Postgres container
  - `SQL_PORT`: Leave it to `5432` if you haven't changed the mapping of the ports in the `docker-compose.prod.yml` **file**
  - `DATABASE`: Leave it to `postgres` if you are using the Postgres container, this way gunicorn will wait for the PG db to be up to start
  - `DEBUG`: Leave it to `0`
  - `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key of Django
- `gunicorn.prod.env`:
  - `ACCESS_LOG`: The `.log` file to use for the access logs of gunicorn
  - `ERROR_LOG`: The `.log` file to use for the error logs of gunicorn

### 3. Build and up the prod images

`docker-compose -f docker/prod/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`

Note: make sure all the images are up and running: `sudo docker ps`, you should see all 3 images (gunicorn, postgres and nginx).

You have trouble there, remove the logging system of gunicorn in `docker/prod/docker-entrypoint.sh` and try with `docker-compose -f docker/prod/docker-compose.prod.yml up --build`

### 4. Django migrations and collectstatic

```
docker-compose -f docker/prod/docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py makemigrations core
docker-compose -f docker/prod/docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py migrate --noinput
docker-compose -f docker/prod/docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### 5. Configure your web server

The Nginx image has the port 1337 mapped to port 80, so you need to configure your web server to route all incoming calls to you app to the port 1337.

If you are using Nginx, you can follow the steps below, otherwise you'll have to look at your server's doc.

1. Configure a new site in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`, and paste the following:

```
upstream picture_gallery {
	server localhost:1337;
}

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name ...; # Set here the name of your domain or subdomain

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://picture_gallery;
        	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        	proxy_redirect off;
	        client_max_body_size 20M;
	}

}
```

2. Enable it:

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<yournewsite> <yournewsite>
```

3. Test the conf by running `nginx -t`. If everything is ok, reload nginx to apply the new conf.

And voil√†!

### Note:

If you start with an empty database, you won't have any user account created, so no way to access to the admin panel. To create one, there's two possibilities:

1. You run the custom `initadmin` command (`docker-compose -f docker/prod/docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py initadmin`). This command wil create a superuser with `admin` as username and password, so be sure to either update it, or create an account with a more secure username and password.

2. Directly run the `createsuperuser` command in the `web` container

```
sudo docker exec -it web /bin/sh # Alpine images doesn't have bash, only sh

python manage.py createsuperuser
```
